final project - brief:

web based shelf configurator

description: make computational designed shelfs available to non designers. enable them to costumize and download the blueprint of their own creation. aim is to build a service from it. 

enable user to select a shelf type. shelf types (goal): 
	1) sin + cosine shelf
	2) jagged
	3) simple rectangular
	4) shifted boxes

make it costumizable through sliders: 
	1) length
	2) height
	3) subdivision 
	4) material thickness
	5) eventually make inclined backside for rooftop apartments

preview manufacturing information: 
	1) area
	2) outline length 
	3) rough cost estimation

buttons: 
	1) download + generate blueprint
		1.1) dwg
		1.2) pdf
	2) contact designer - enabling costumers to get in touch with me. 
	3) get it manufactured - request for pricing for austria + germany.
